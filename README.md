# R Programming A-Z™: R For Data Science With Real Exercises!
## Homework: Law of Large Number

```
N <- 100
counter <- 0
for(i in rnorm(N)){
  if(i > -1 & i < 1){
    counter <- counter + 1
  }
}

answer <- counter / N
answer
```
Hasilnya adalah 0.71 artinya 71%, tetapi hasil tersebut bisa saja berubah. Hal tersebut terjadi karena rnorm mengambil angka sembarang dari suatu distribusi normal

#Data
revenue <- c(14574.49, 7606.46, 8611.41, 9175.41, 8058.65, 8105.44, 11496.28, 9766.09, 10305.32, 14379.96, 10713.97, 15433.50)
expenses <- c(12051.82, 5695.07, 12319.20, 12089.72, 8658.57, 840.20, 3285.73, 5821.12, 6976.93, 16618.61, 10054.37, 3803.96)

#Solution
#Calculate Profit As The Differences Between Revenue And Expenses
profit <- revenue - expenses
profit

#Calculate Tax As 30% Of Profit And Round To 2 Decimal Points
tax <- round(0.30 * profit, 2)
tax 

#Calculate Profit Remaining After Tax Is Deducted
profit.after.tax <- profit - tax
profit.after.tax

#Calculate The Profit Margin As Profit After Tax Over Revenue
#Round To 2 Decimal Points, Then Multiply By 100 To Get %
profit.margin <- round(profit.after.tax / revenue, 2) * 100
profit.margin

#Calculate The Mean Profit After Tax For The 12 Months
mean_pat <- mean(profit.after.tax)
mean_pat

#Find The Months With Above-Mean Profit After Tax
good.months <- profit.after.tax > mean_pat
good.months

#Bad Months Are The Opposite Of Good Months !
bad.months <- !good.months
bad.months

#The Best Month Is Where Profit After Tax Was Equal To The Maximum
best.month <- profit.after.tax == max(profit.after.tax)
best.month

#The Worst Month Is Where Profit After Tax Was Equal To The Minimum
worst.month <- profit.after.tax == min(profit.after.tax)
worst.month

#Convert All Calculations To Units Of One Thousand Dollars
revenue.1000 <- round(revenue / 1000, 0)
expenses.1000 <- round(expenses / 1000, 0)
profit.1000 <- round(profit / 1000, 0)
profit.after.tax.1000 <- round(profit.after.tax / 1000, 0)

#Print Results

#Part 1 - Free Throw Attempts Per Game 
#(You will need the Games matrix)
myplot(FreeThrowAttempts/Games)
#Notice how Chris Paul gets few attempts per game

#Part 2 - Free Throw Accuracy
myplot(FreeThrows/FreeThrowAttempts)
#And yet Chris Paul's accuracy is one of the highest
#Chances are his team would get more points if he had more FTA's
#Also notice that Dwight Howard's FT Accuracy is extremely poor
#compared to other players. If you recall, Dwight Howard's
#Field Goal Accuracy was exceptional:
myplot(FieldGoals/FieldGoalAttempts)
#How could this be? Why is there such a drastic difference?
#We will see just now...

#Part 3 - Player Style Patterns Excluding Free Throws
myplot((Points-FreeThrows)/FieldGoals)
#Because we have excluded free throws, this plot now shows us
#the true representation of player style change. We can verify
#that this is the case because all the marks without exception
#on this plot are between 2 and 3. That is because Field Goals
#can only be for either 2 points or 3 points.
#Insights:
#1. You can see how players' preference for 2 or 3 point shots
#   changes throughout their career. We can see that almost all
#   players in this dataset experiment with their style throughout
#   their careers. Perhaps, the most drastic change in style has
#   been experienced by Joe Johnson.
#2. There is one exception. You can see that one player has not
#   changed his style at all - almost always scoring only 2-pointers.
#   Who is this mystert player? It's Dwight Howard! 
#   Now that explains a lot. The reason that Dwight Howard's
#   Field Goal accuracy is so good is because he almost always
#   scores 2-pointers only. That means he can be close to the basket
#   or even in contact with it. Free throws, on the other hand require
#   the player to stand 15ft (4.57m) away from the hoop. That's 
#   probably why Dwight Howard's Free Throw Accuracy is poor.
